\title{Import peak annotation data}
\usage{
import_peak_annotation(sampleId, peakAnnoFile, peakFile, bwFile,
  fcCutoff = 1, pvalCutoff = 1, columns = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampleId}{sample ID}

\item{peakAnnoFile}{macs2 peak target gene found by \code{macs2 narrowPeak output |
bedtools closest | perl bedtoolsClosestPeakAnnotate.pl}}

\item{peakFile}{macs2 output file. Should be narrowPeak or broadPeak file}

\item{bwFile}{bigWig format coverage track file}

\item{fcCutoff}{fold enrichment cutoff for the peak. Default: 1 i.e. no cutoff}

\item{pvalCutoff}{log10_pvalue cutoff for the peak. Default: 1 i.e. no cutoff}

\item{columns}{A vector of column names which should be returned. Allowed values are: \code{c(
"hasPeak", "peakPosition", "peakType", "peakId", "peakEnrichment", "peakPval", "peakQval",
"peakSummit", "peakDist", "summitDist", "bidirectional", "featureCovFrac", "relativeSummitPos",
"peakRegion", "peakCoverage")}. Default: all columns are returned}
}
\value{
A peak annotation as dataframe
}
\description{
This function reads the '*.nearestCDS.tab' file generated by command:
\code{macs2 narrowPeak output | bedtools closest | perl bedtoolsClosestPeakAnnotate.pl}.
For each peak, it calculates the peak coverage values.
